# l.r.a.r - Lazy Roommate Avoidance Registry

![l.r.a.r Dashboard](./backend/assets/lrar_landing_page.png)

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **l.r.a.r - Lazy Roommate Avoidance Registry**!  
Our goal is to reduce paper waste in our frat house by digitizing essential tracking systems such as the dishwasher counter, burn counter, and more. This project provides a centralized platform for tenants to monitor and manage household responsibilities efficiently, promoting accountability and fostering a harmonious living environment.

## 2. Features

- **Chore Management**: Track and rotate household chores among tenants.
- **Burn System**: Allow tenants to assign burns with reasons for not fulfilling their responsibilities.
- **Real-time Updates**: View current statuses and burn counts instantly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend built with modern technologies.

## 3. Technologies

This project leverages modern technologies to provide a robust and efficient solution:

- **Frontend**: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) for building a high-performance, asynchronous API.
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for reliable data storage.
- **ORM**: [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) for seamless interaction between the backend and the database.

## 4. Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend development)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for backend development)
- `make` (build automation tool)
- `git` (version control system)

## 5. Installation

### 5.1 Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonasmorkland/lrar.git
cd lrar
```

### 5.2 Start the Application with Docker Compose

To set up and run the entire project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd lrar
   ```

2. **Start the Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   This command builds and starts the Docker containers for the frontend, backend, and database services.

3. **Verify Containers:**

   Check if all containers are running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## 6. Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

This gracefully stops all containers without removing them.

To remove containers, networks, and volumes, use:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 7. Database Management

### 7.1 Populate Database

To populate the database with initial data, run the following command in the same directory as the Makefile:

```bash
make populate
```

### 7.2 Empty Database

To remove all records from the `tenants` and `burn` tables:

```bash
make empty
```

### 7.3 Database Migrations

Manage schema changes using Diesel migrations.

1. **Generate a New Migration:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it lrar_backend bin/bash
   diesel migration generate <migration-name>
   ```

   Replace `<migration-name>` with a descriptive name for your migration, e.g., `create-table-tenant`.

2. **Edit `up.sql` and `down.sql`:**

   - Define the SQL statements to apply the migration in `up.sql`.
   - Define the SQL statements to revert the migration in `down.sql`.

3. **Apply the Migration:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it lrar_backend diesel migration run
   ```

4. **Revert the Migration:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it lrar_backend diesel migration revert
   ```
